		<h2>About</h2>

		<blockquote>“The landscape of Northwestern Ontario has a weight to it; from the ancient mass of the Canadian
			Shield
			underfoot to the ponderous silence of the boreal forest, there’s something about this region that naturally
			conveys a sense of heaviness.” – Kate Erickson
		</blockquote>
		<p>Emerging in the punk scenes of dirty basements and sleazy bars pockmarked along the great Canadian rock, 1971
			has
			steadily grown into a mature sound that is uniquely their own. Over the years, they slowly departed from
			their
			roots into a something that is strange but familiar; channelling lightness from indie rock, song structures
			and
			writing styles of American folk and country music while maintaining the energy and passion from their youths
			as
			misguided punks. The weight they carry comes from a very real place somewhere between the tranquil woods and
			the
			riotous city streets.</p>
		<p>The three founding members, Cameron Cranston (bass guitar/vocals), Garrett Iverson (guitar/vocals) and Jory
			Strachan (drums/vocals) formed in 2011 and have, in a way, been helplessly bound to each other as if by
			blood
			since. Diving into the unknown in a dilapidated van as teenagers, through tumultuous troubles, heartbreak,
			and
			the road’s wonders and trials, the three have continued to make music and art together, enlisting friends to
			collaborate on the project along the way.</p>
		<p>Early on the three left the town of Kenora and found a place for themselves in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Close
			friend
			Tanner Neil joined the band spring of 2016 and toured with that following summer.</p>
		
		<p>On February 13th, 2017 bassist, founding member and best friend Cameron Glen Cranston suddenly passed away in
			the
			Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Center. He was 25 years old.</p>
		<p>The band decided not to continue without their brother.</p>
		<p>After his passing the remaining members, Garrett Iverson, Jory Strachan and Tanner Neil decided to release
			the
			last existing recordings of the band with Cameron; two demos they recorded for a recording fund grant
			application they received with the songs ‘The Manipulator’ and ‘Anxiety’.</p>
		<p>The songs, accompanied by a third ‘Etinohah’, written and recorded by Cameron Glen Cranston, will be released
			on
			cassette with Art of the Uncarved Block and on 7” vinyl on December 1st, 2017 in honor of Cam and as a final
			memento for the band.</p>
		<p>A compilation album of the band’s career will also be accompanying the release, featuring previously
			unreleased
			live version of their first song “TIME”, on double cassette with Art of the Uncarved Block and on compact
			disc.</p>
		
		<blockquote>“A noisy domineering soundscape that is lush and verdant like a well-kept garden” – Diamond
			Deposits,
			2016
		</blockquote>
		
		<blockquote>“Whether the four-piece are incorporating slow and sludgy beats, or showing off their more melodic
			side
			with fast-paced rock'n'roll, 1971 remain dedicated to honouring the punk ethos they've grown up with:
			committing
			to "absolute freedom of expression."” – Exclaim!
		</blockquote>
		
		<blockquote>“Huge noise, beautiful crescendos, and incredible sound keeps me coming back to them on a
			close-to-daily
			basis.”– Mind The Music T.O.
